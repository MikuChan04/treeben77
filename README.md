Hi, I’m @TreeBen77, I'm a self-tuaght python and lua developer. I like making discord bots and sometimes faulty Roblox places.

- I’m currently learning: more Python, Discord bots on Python (discord.py) and Roblox Studio (Lua)
- I’m possibly looking to collaborate on discord bot creation
- You can reach me on discord, join my testing server on discord (https://discord.gg/7TEK7dET)
